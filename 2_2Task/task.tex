  \item By doing the tutorial it helped me to evaluate my code
    and actually notice mistakes that I've made in the algorithm.
    For example, in line 46 of my code I delay(UNIT); in order to
    create the short pause between dots and dashes.
    This, however, is a mistake, as when a space is excecuted,
    it delays for e.g. 300ms, then when the next component is read,
    it delays again for 100ms before writing to high.
    This is an error and should be fixed, as it just adds
    100ms to pauses for no good reason.
