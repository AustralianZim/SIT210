  \item In order to modify the code to write something else, for example ``HELLO WORLD'' instead of my full name,
    a morse code table has to be looked up, as the program has no way of translating text to morse.
    Then the phrase (String) variable is changed to the desired message, 
    using dots `.', dashes `-', spaces between characters ` ', and underscores between words `_'
  \item I tried to make my code reusable by keeping the morse_units() function basic.
